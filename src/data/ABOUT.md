# ABOUT – THE HUMAN ERROR 404

Yeah, we roast careers for breakfast.
But let’s be real for five seconds.

A handful of hoodie-wearing tech bros in San Francisco and Seattle are currently deciding, over oat-milk lattes and ping-pong tables, which jobs live and which ones get quietly deleted from existence.

They don’t ask permission.
They don’t send a memo.

One day you’re a “10x Senior Product Manager with impactful cross-functional synergies” and the next day your entire function is a $9/month plugin.

That’s not “progress.”
That’s a layoff with extra steps.

This site exists to rip the mask off that bullshit.
We turn the mirror around so you can see, in real time, exactly how close the cliff is.

Some of you will get the **“YOU WIN CAPITALISM”** screen and laugh at the coders.
Most of you will get the **“YOUR CAREER HAS BEEN LAID OFF”** screen and feel your stomach drop.

Good.
Feel it.
Because denial is what got us here.

## How to actually survive the next ten years (no cap):

- **Learn something that can’t be copy-pasted.**
Welding, plumbing, electrical, nursing, heavy equipment, childcare, eldercare, therapy, trades that require hands, judgment, and showing up when it’s 110° or -20°. Robots are allergic to liability, weather, and human messiness.

- **Own the robots, don’t compete with them.**
The guy who owns the robotic bricklaying company is still a mason — he just has 40 robot employees now. Learn the tech, buy the tools, be the foreman of the machines.

- **Stack multiple income streams like you stack LeetCode problems.**
Rental properties, side businesses, niche trades, local monopolies. The 400k TC golden handcuffs are turning into cardboard.

- **Move where the robots aren’t (yet).**
Small towns, rural areas, and anywhere that still needs humans to fix shit when the power goes out.

- **Build real skills and real relationships.**
The people who will hire you when the algorithms fire you are the ones who’ve seen you swing a hammer, fix their toilet, or carry their grandma down the stairs.

We’re not anti-technology.
We’re anti-delusion.

The future isn’t “everyone becomes a prompt engineer.”
The future is some of you become millionaires owning robot fleets…
and the rest of you better have calluses and a strong back.

So go ahead.
Type your job.
Laugh, cry, screenshot it, send it to your group chat.

Then close the tab and go learn how to actually build or fix something that can’t be replaced by a $20 API call.

See you on the job site, meatbag.
